A: <p>I would not call it a critical disadvantage, but the biggest problem I have seen is one of developer experience and ability to adapt.  Not all developers yet understand the difference between declarative and imperative programming.</p>\n<p>We make use of the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc309507.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">policy injection application block</a> in EntLib 4.1 pretty extensively as well as <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/unity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Unity</a> for DI and it's just not something that sinks in quickly for some people.  I find myself explaining over and over again to the same people why the application is not behaving in the way they expect.  It generally starts off them explaining something and me saying &quot;see that declaration above the method.&quot; :)  Some people get it right away, love it and become extremely productive, but others struggle.</p>\n<p>A learning curve is not unique to AOP, but it seems to have a higher learning curve than other things that your average developer encounters.</p>\n", "tags": ["aop"]}

Therefore, you should not be calling any stream I/O functions from the C++ standard library in the signal handler, as this may cause the program to crash.</p>\n<p>However, depending on which platform you are using, it is likely possible to print output from the signal handler in a safe way.</p>\n<p>For example, on Linux, it is safe to call functions that are explicitly listed as <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal-safety.7.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>async-signal-safe</code></a>. The system call <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>write</code></a> (which bypasses the C++ stream) is a function that is marked as <code>async-signal-safe</code>, so it allows you to print output safely from a signal handler.</p>\n", "tags": ["c++", "multithreading", "stack-trace", "c++23"]}

If you're willing to do that, a more targeted question might have been, &quot;In Git Flow, can I reset <code>master</code> to <code>release</code> instead of merging <code>release</code> into <code>master</code>?&quot; The answer to that question would have been, &quot;Yes if you want to, but you lose the feature of the deployment history in a single place, which standard Git Flow provides.&quot;</p>\n", "tags": ["git", "git-flow"]}
