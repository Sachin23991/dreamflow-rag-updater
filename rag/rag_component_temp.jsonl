In most cases that should go without conflicts, but still. Also, either we test release branch and then re-test the merged master branch (if we are going to use it for deployment), or we merge and only then test, or we don't use master for deployment at all. In first case, it's extra efforts for extra branch; second case looks different from git-flow where each chart says &quot;bugfixes on the release branch&quot; (besides, new release gets merged into master even before it's actually tested and released, and that actually breaks the rule that master only contains actually released releases); and in the last case, it's even more &quot;why have it then?&quot; - only for one benefit of having some place where all released branch are listed in chronological order?</p>\n", "tags": ["git", "git-flow"]}
