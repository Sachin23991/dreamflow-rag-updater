A: <p>C++ has an <strong>ISO standard</strong> that defines the language, including what a <em>main function</em> is.</p>\n<p>cppreference.com is a common reference that mostly comes from the standard documents, but a little bit more friendly to read, search and compare between different standard versions.</p>\n<p>You can consult <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/main_function.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cppreference.com page for &quot;main function&quot;</a> to see what is required for a <code>main</code> function, including its return type and the meaning of its return value. What you mentioned by &quot;the compiler will generate <code>return 0;</code> for you&quot; is also explicitly stated in the standard, not merely a compiler's decision.</p>\n<p>Note that with respect to the return value of <code>main</code>, the standard says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Execution of the return (or the implicit return upon reaching the end of main) is equivalent to first leaving the function normally (which destroys the objects with automatic storage duration and evaluates any postcondition assertions of main) and then calling <code>std::exit</code> with the same argument as the argument of the return (<code>std::exit</code> then destroys static objects and terminates the program).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/program/exit.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">std::exit</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Control is returned to the host environment. If <code>exit_code</code> is <code>0</code> or <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code>, an implementation-defined status indicating successful termination is returned. If <code>exit_code</code> is <code>EXIT_FAILURE</code>, an implementation-defined status indicating unsuccessful termination is returned. In other cases implementation-defined status value is returned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually, the programmer has much freedom to decide what value to return. For example, <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the <code>grep</code> command's manual</a> says that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Normally the exit status is 0 if a line is selected, 1 if no lines were selected, and 2 if an error occurred.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "tags": ["c++", "compiler-optimization"]}
