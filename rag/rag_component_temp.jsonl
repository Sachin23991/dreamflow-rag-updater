A: <p>I had a similar issue couple of years back with a proto that imported another proto. Long story short, I spent about a week on this, tried all the public python proto generation libs I could find on Github but still couldn't solve the issue. The final solution was to fix the relative path of the import inline using <code>sed</code> as part of the build script. Trust me, anyone seeing this issue in the future, it's not worth spending time fixing it, just figure out the correct path and write a script to replace the imports in the generated files.</p>\n", "tags": ["python", "protocol-buffers", "grpc"]}
