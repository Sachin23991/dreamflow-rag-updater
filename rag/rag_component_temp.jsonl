A: <blockquote>\n<p>Is it possible to create one interface for testbench and for modules\nconnection?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, it is possible to create an interface that can be used in both design and testbench modules.  This is a common practice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Am I misunderstanding the purpose of interfaces?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this case, yes, there is some misunderstanding of usage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it possible to get rid of this warnings?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It behaves as expected aside from the warnings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is great that you are paying attention to the warnings and that you are also trying to fix them.  That shows great instincts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>commercial simulator (I don't have access to them in edaplayground).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do have access to all the simulators on EDA Playground.  I created an account there years ago.  I strongly recommend that you try to create your own account, if you have not already done so.  It is well worth the effort.  Contact their support if you have trouble creating an account or accessing all the simulators.</p>\n<p>I tried running your code on two other simulators (Cadence and Synopsys), and they both show similar messages (errors and/or warnings).  The Synopsys simulator runs, and produces reasonable results, like you see on modelsim.  But, the warning message mentions that the simulator will treat it as a compile error in a future version.  This is definitely code that you should fix.</p>\n<p>Both of the other simulators produce a little more information about the nature of the problem, but they don't tell you how to fix the code.  I find your code to be confusing in a number of areas.  I assume the design is some variant of the AMBA AXI bus, based on the signal names.  AXI is a complex design architecture, and I am surprised that you are trying to combine all of the logic of a bus master and slave into a single <code>always</code> block, let alone a single module.</p>\n<p>I recommend splitting the design code up into master and slave portions.  Your code uses several advanced features, such as interfaces, modports and clocking blocks.  If you do not have a lot of familiarity with them yet, I suggest taking a step back and getting your code to work without them for now.  Then gradually add them in one at a time.</p>\n", "tags": ["verilog", "system-verilog", "modelsim"]}
