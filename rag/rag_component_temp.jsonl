A: <p>while the other solutions provided here are more than OK, to answer your literal question &quot;How to condense multiple boolean colummns into one column&quot; the answer is bitmasks. You can make an enum from your badges, where each badge have a value as a power of 2 and store the sum of all the assigned badges for a user into 1 column.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-php prettyprint-override\"><code>$user-&gt;update(['badges' =&gt; Badge::badge1-&gt;value | Badge::badge3-&gt;value]);\n$user-&gt;badges &amp; Badge::badge1-&gt;value; // true\n$user-&gt;badges &amp; Badge::badge2-&gt;value; // false\n$user-&gt;badges &amp; Badge::badge3-&gt;value; // true\n</code></pre>\n<p>from this you can easily make a custom cast for your bitmask to get/set a list of enums instead of int values.</p>\n", "tags": ["mysql", "laravel", "database-design"]}
{"id": "3081fdeb-dfc7-4ad7-8493-84a2aae6df08", "text": "Q: Converting an UTF-16 index to a UTF-8 compatible one A: <p>Old question, but it came up in my feed.  You want to store the raw UTF-16 bytes returned by this API, after any endian-conversion necessary, in a <code>Vec[u16]</code>.  Extract the substring you want from this entity by turning the provided offset and length into a <code>&amp;[u16]</code> array slice, perhaps with code like:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-rust prettyprint-override\"><code>let start_index_utf16 = entity.offset as usize;\nlet end_index_utf16 = start_offset + entity.length as usize;\nlet substring: &amp;[u16] = &amp;utf16_raw[start_offset..end_offset];\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can then pass the slice to <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.from_utf16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>String::from_utf16</code></a>  to convert to UTF-8.</p>\n<p>If all you have is the UTF-8 string, you have to iterate, although you could speed that up by caching \u201cbreadcrumbs\u201d that index what UTF-8 index various UTF-16 indices correspond to. This allows you to start from the middle of the string, not the beginning.</p>\n<p>You also don\u2019t need to fully convert, just quickly count the number of codepoints inside and the number outside the basic multilingual plane.  You can do this efficiently by scanning the bytes in the string and adding 2 for each byte greater than or equal to <code>0xf0</code> (the lead byte of a four-byte UTF-8 sequence corresponding to a UTF-16 surrogate-pair), 1 for each byte between <code>0x00</code> and <code>0x7f</code> (an ASCII character) or between <code>0xc0</code> and <code>0xef</code> (the lead byte of a non-ASCII character from the basic multilingual plane) and 0 for each byte between <code>0x80</code> and <code>0xbf</code> (a continuation byte).     This can be implemented as a SIMD map-reduce.</p>\n", "tags": ["utf-8", "utf-16"]}
