(Well you can, but it won't help<sup>1</sup>.)</p>\n<p>What you need to do is build and distribute an installer.  Prior to Java 9, the recommended way to create an installer is to use a commercial or open-source installer generator.  (Google will help you find one.)</p>\n<p>It is also possible to do embed a JRE in a ZIP file, as described here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7071133/how-to-bundle-a-jre-with-launch4j\">How to bundle a JRE with Launch4j?</a> (see the accepted answer)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ZIP file contains the JRE and the application JAR, and other files that it needs.  The user has to unzip the ZIP file to install the application.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>.. but it's copying total JRE in client system of almost 100 MB.  Is it possible to make JRE light weight?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not really.  The most (legal) light-weight way to distribute a JRE is to distribute an Oracle Java installer.  Beware that the Java Binary License forbids the distribution of a cut-down JRE.  If you want to go down that path <em>talk to a lawyer first!!</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Distributing Java apps with an embedded JRE is arguably a bad thing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It fills up the user's disk with multiple JREs.</li>\n<li>The JREs tend to be hidden away / not visible to normal security updates / patching / audits.  Hence they tend to become a security liability.</li>\n<li>You need to regularly update your distributables ... to avoid foisting out-of-date / insecure JREs on the unsuspecting user.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>From Java 9 onwards there is a better solution than including a standard JRE in your installer.  Use the new <code>jlink</code> utility to create a tailored JRE for your application; see <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/jlink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.baeldung.com/jlink</a> for a tutorial, and the Oracle <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/jlink.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jlink manual entry</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that <code>jlink</code> addresses the concerns with embedded JREs that we mentioned above.  But it <strong>clearly makes it your responsibility<sup>2</sup></strong> to provide JVM security patches to your users in the form of new jlink'd distributables.</p>\n<p>From Java 14 onwards you can use <code>jpackager</code> to create an installer or installable for your application.  This will include an embedded JRE and a custom launcher.</p>\n<p>Finally, you could consider using GraalVM to generate (platform specific) executable binaries for your application.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - This is a chicken and egg problem.  In order to run an executable JAR you need a minimal JRE to load and run the Java code in the JAR.  But if the only JRE you have is inside the JAR, what is going to cause that to be unpacked into a form that can be executed?  And how?<br>\n2 - In reality, it has <em>always</em> been an application supplier / vendor's responsibility to advise and assist customers in upgrading embedded JREs.  Unfortunately, many vendors neglected this, leading to customers running applications with known Java vulnerabilities, and Sun/Oracle getting the blame ... unfairly ... for the vendor's failings.</sup></p>\n", "tags": ["java", "bundle", "exe", "packaging", "maven-shade-plugin"]}
