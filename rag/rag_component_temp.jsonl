(so ... exceeding the allowed 300 limit)</p>\n<p>To fix this problem, there are 3 ways:</p>\n<p>(A) you may close the resources used (after the query ends), such as:</p>\n<pre><code> $this-&gt;db-&gt;close();\n// then establish a new db connection if needed (inside the loop)\n// by slight amendment of your database-related statements\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: (1) The above is only a hint (since I don't have your full code). Make sure after you close the connection, you will create a new connection if needed (So one of the ways is to enclose the &quot;new connection / query execution / close connection&quot; block inside a loop.)</p>\n<p>In my experience, better create and use a new db connection which is different from the original db connection so that your code amendments will not affect other database statements in your script</p>\n<p>So, something like the following in one of my own projects :</p>\n<pre><code>\n $conn = new mysqli($host, $dbuser, $dbpw, $dbname);\n  //// lots of statements using $conn .....\n\nfor ($index=0; $index &lt;10; $index++) {\n\n /// use $conn2 so that closing it will not cause other problems\n\n  $conn2 = new mysqli($host, $dbuser, $dbpw, $dbname);\n\n     $sql2 = &quot;SELECT * FROM [tablename] WHERE id=?&quot; ;\n     $stmt2 = $conn2-&gt;prepare($sql2); \n     $stmt2-&gt;bind_param(&quot;i&quot;, $index);\n     $stmt2-&gt;execute();\n     $result2 = $stmt2-&gt;get_result(); // get the mysqli result\n     $c2 = $result2-&gt;fetch_assoc();\n   // etc....\n\n  $conn2-&gt;close();\n}\n\n// continue to use $conn, if necessary\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Hope the the above code can give you some hints to help you fix your problem. (based on your code which I think you need to create the object of the db class, execute the query and then call close() method to close the connection, all within the loop)</p>\n<p>(B) Alternatively, you may change the open_cursors value to a higher value. If your system has sufficient resources then set it as 1000 is also ok.</p>\n<p>Say <strong>execute</strong> the following query at the top of your script:</p>\n<pre><code> $startquery = &quot;ALTER SYSTEM SET open_cursors = 1000 SCOPE=BOTH;&quot;;\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>(C) But the above (option B) will only apply to that particular script, if you want to do it permanently and globally, you need to modify the SPFILE (using ALTER SYSTEM) and restart the database. (but of course you may need to have the <code>ALTER SYSTEM</code> system privilege to use this option)</p>\n<p>Of course, option A - amend the code to avoid the issue, will be the best option (that's why I put it as the top one). But for me, I am open to (option B) and (option C) too. (changing system parameters are not evil at all in my opinion, as long as you understand what you are doing and what will be the impact)</p>\n", "tags": ["php", "oracle-database"]}
