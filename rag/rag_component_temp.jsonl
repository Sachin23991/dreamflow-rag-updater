{"id": "10761241-9a87-496b-9518-a8dd057ab2b3", "text": "Q: How to optimize enum size? A: <p>The first thing to note is that this sort of <code>enum</code> couldn't possibly be stored in just 16 bytes, given the current definition of <code>Pc</code> and assuming 8-byte <code>usize</code>. The reason is that the <code>Split(Pc, Pc)</code> possibility takes up all possible 16-byte bit patterns on its own (because any such pattern can be interpreted as two <code>usizes</code>), so there would be no room for the other possibilities.</p>\n<p>If the <code>enum</code> is going to take up more than 16 bytes, it would need to take up 24 bytes for alignment reasons. The issue is that many processors can't efficiently read numbers from memory unless their address is a multiple of the number's size; for example, 64-bit processors might not be able to read a <code>usize</code> unless its address is a multiple of 8. This means that if you decided to store many <code>enum Inst</code>s in an array or vector, the address of each element must be a multiple of 8, so the distance between the elements must also be a multiple of 8, and thus their size when placed in an array must be a multiple of 8. If it's a multiple of 8, and larger than 16, it must be at least 24. (Some languages have an optimization to allow for types to be smaller when handled outside an array than when placed inside an array, but Rust doesn't \u2013 it simplifies things by ensuring that any given type always has a single representation, at least within a single compile.)</p>\n<p>One other thing to be aware of is that Rust's <code>enum</code> layout optimisations only cover a particular set of cases. At the time of writing, an <code>enum</code> like this (slightly modified from yours) is also 24 bytes:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-rust prettyprint-override\"><code>type Pc = usize;\n\npub enum Inst {\n    Char(Pc, char),\n    Range(Pc, char, char),\n    Any(Pc),\n    Split(Pc, u32),\n    Jump(Pc),\n    Match,\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is despite the fact that this <code>enum</code> trivially could be stored in 16 bytes (e.g. by storing the fields in order and the discriminant at the end). It isn't at present simply because the Rust compiler doesn't have a case for optimising this sort of <code>enum</code> \u2013 the current <code>enum</code> optimizations are all based on &quot;niches&quot; (Rust describes types as having a &quot;niche&quot; if they don't use all the possible bit patterns that would fit into their size, e.g. <code>NonZeroUsize</code> doesn't use all-bits-zero), whereas there are no niches in any of the types stored in the <code>enum</code> and thus no optimizations are attempted (and a naive layout algorithm gives a size of 24 bytes because it sees <code>Range</code> and <code>Split</code> as &quot;16 bytes&quot; due to alignment rounding).</p>\n<p>It's possible that Rust will add more <code>enum</code> optimizations in the future \u2013 the exact layout of <code>enum</code>s mostly isn't a stable part of the language (with a few specific exceptions like <code>#[repr(C)]</code> and <code>Option&lt;Box&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> which don't help here), and it's one of those parts of the language which was intentionally left open for future optimisations. So it's possible that my example <code>enum</code> will be 16 bytes in the future. But the <code>enum</code> that you gave originally does have to be at least 24 bytes in order to work under Rust's sizing assumptions.</p>\n<p>If you're looking to make the <code>enum</code> smaller, there are two main tricks you can use. One is to use types with niches in order to provide optimization opportunities, but it won't help in this case: for example, if you make <code>Pc</code> into <code>NonZeroUsize</code>, there <em>still</em> isn't enough room to fit all the <code>enum</code> cases into 16 bytes (in theory, <code>Split</code> could be stored as (Pc, Pc), <code>Any</code> as (Pc, 0), <code>Jump</code> as (0, Pc), and <code>Match</code> as (0, 0), but that still leaves <code>Char</code> and <code>Range</code> unaccounted for). Note that Rust won't optimize <code>enum</code>s in this sort of complicated way anyway, because it causes runtime performance issues (if you're doing a complicated matrix of cases like this, you have to read too much of the <code>enum</code> to figure out what its discriminant is) \u2013 so even with <code>NonZeroUsize</code> and without <code>Char</code> and <code>Range</code>, Rust wouldn't optimize your particular <code>enum</code>. In order to make it work, you would have to use types with bigger niches (i.e. fewer valid representations) \u2013 but as of right now, there are few such types in stable Rust, and the ones that are (such as <code>char</code> which can't represent values above 0x10FFFF, and <code>&amp;[T]</code> which can't represent lengths above <code>isize::MAX</code>) aren't really useful in solving the problem you have.</p>\n<p>The other approach is to store some of the data out of line by using <code>Box</code>, e.g. by replacing <code>Split(Pc, Pc)</code> with <code>Split(Box&lt;(Pc, Pc)&gt;)</code>. This is often a helpful technique in cases where one or two of the variants are <em>much</em> larger than the others (especially if they're rarely used). However, it won't help in this case because your variants are too similar in size (and not that much larger than <code>Box</code> anyway). In theory, <code>Split(Box&lt;(Pc, Pc)&gt;)</code> might be able to get down to 16 bytes if Rust optimized perfectly, but as in my example above, Rust currently doesn't have an optimization for this case so doing this in present Rust won't reduce the <code>enum</code> below 24 bytes.</p>\n", "tags": ["rust", "enums", "padding", "memory-alignment", "micro-optimization"]}

polygons</strong> so multiple separated polygon vertice arrays.</p>\n<p>In other words:<br />\nYou need to &quot;group&quot; connected curves for pointed corners \u2013 otherwise\nall vertices are connected to a single polyline and may result in weird renderings like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oJ9Wj08A.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oJ9Wj08A.png\" alt=\"Polygon\" /></a></p>\n<p>I've used Wikipedia contributor <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/b/b5/20081219104753%21OR_ANSI.svg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jbeard's SVG example</a></p>\n<p>In this case we need to create multiple separate shape objects:</p>\n<p>While we could do this grouping programmatically by comparing start and end points of segments it's usually easier to do this visually in a graphic editor like Inkscape.</p>\n<p>However, this common lack of sub-path definitions is a common pitfall so we need to be careful how we process our graphics \u2013 a sub path splitting/grouping is necessary for most applications.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: even in SVG we need to use <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> as <code>&lt;polyline&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;polygon&gt;</code> only supports flat vertex arrays.</p>\n<h3>SVG 2 pathData notation</h3>\n<p>For your data structure you may also take inspiration from the <a href=\"https://svgwg.org/specs/paths/#InterfaceSVGPathData\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SVG pathData notation</a> as suggested in SVG 2 draft that describes vector/bezier commands as an array of objects like so:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-json prettyprint-override\"><code>let pathData = [\n   {\n    type: 'M',\n    values: [43,20]\n   },\n   {\n    type: 'Q',\n    values: [85,24,110,60]\n   }\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The main advantage of this notation is the balance between verbosity and simplicity \u2013 all command types have the same number of object properties and can easily be concatenated to rendered SVG <code>d</code> strings. Since we have a <code>type</code> property we can switch different calculations according to the type without the need to introduce different properties for each type.</p>\n<p>So a cleaned up output \u2013 that could be used in your asset data structure may look like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-json prettyprint-override\"><code>{\n id: 'OR_Gate',\n name: 'OR Gate',\n anchorPoint: [80,60],\n shapes: [\n  [\n   {\n    type: 'M',\n    values: [43,20]\n   },\n   {\n    type: 'Q',\n    values: [85,24,110,60]\n   },\n   {\n    type: 'Q',\n    values: [85,96,43,100]\n   },\n   {\n    type: 'Q',\n    values: [60,60,43,20]\n   },\n   {\n    type: 'Z',\n    values: []\n   }\n  ]\n ]\n}  \n</code></pre>\n<h3>Quadratic vs Cubic B\u00e9ziers vs Arcs</h3>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with using quadratic B\u00e9ziers (compact notation, many advantages for geometry calculations) the main reason the vast majority of graphic applications solely use cubic B\u00e9ziers is they can replicate more complex curvatures and are more intuitive to handle in a UI (subjective).</p>\n<p>Regardless of the language you can easily calculate points on B\u00e9ziers for polyline approximations based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Casteljau%27s_algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">De Casteljau algorithm</a> like so (you already did this):</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>// cubic\nlet pt = {\n  x:\n  t1 ** 3 * p0.x +\n  3 * t1 ** 2 * t * cp1.x +\n  3 * t1 * t ** 2 * cp2.x +\n  t ** 3 * p.x,\n  y:\n  t1 ** 3 * p0.y +\n  3 * t1 ** 2 * t * cp1.y +\n  3 * t1 * t ** 2 * cp2.y +\n  t ** 3 * p.y\n};\n\n// quadratic\nlet pt = {\n  x: t1 * t1 * p0.x + 2 * t1 * t * cp1.x + t ** 2 * p.x,\n  y: t1 * t1 * p0.y + 2 * t1 * t * cp1.y + t ** 2 * p.y\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where <code>p0</code> is the previous segments on-path coordinate, <code>cp1</code>, <code>cp2</code> the respective control points, <code>p</code> the commands final on-path point and <code>t</code> a number between 0 and 1 \u2013 e.g steps of 0.25 would split a curve to 4 vertices.</p>\n<h4>&quot;Proper&quot; Arc segments?</h4>\n<p>These are in 99% percent converted to something like cubic or polyline approximations. So all in all clearly overrated: you won't be able to tell the difference in any rendering or output despite the geometrical inaccuracy of cubic approximations (also, no output device is by any means mathematically accurate)</p>\n<h3>Y-Axis</h3>\n<p>Also a common pitfall is the interpretation of Y coordinates. Many applications use a top to bottom y-axis (e.g SVG, Canvas) others use the traditional Cartesian bottom to top y-axis system (e.g PDF or Opentype fonts).\nSo depending on your target format and your coordinate notation you may need to &quot;flip&quot; y-coordinates by subtracting the document height from each y-value (or the opposite).</p>\n<h3>Using graphic applications for asset creation</h3>\n<p>As mentioned design tasks are way more intuitive using a GUI.<br />\nBut for a calculable coordinate structure we need to be careful the application returns a &quot;non-optimized&quot; output by means of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all coordinates should be absolute</li>\n<li>no shorthand commands e.g <code>H</code>, <code>v</code>, <code>S</code> or <code>T</code> (reflecting previous coordinates)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>JS Example/Proof of concept (polyline generation from json)</p>\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"true\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\" data-babel-preset-react=\"false\" data-babel-preset-ts=\"false\">\n<div class=\"snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden\">\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>let shapesJson = `{\"id\":\"OR_Gate\",\"name\":\"OR Gate\",\"anchorPoint\":[80,60],\"shapes\":[[{\"type\":\"M\",\"values\":[15,9]},{\"type\":\"L\",\"values\":[5,9]}],[{\"type\":\"M\",\"values\":[15,21]},{\"type\":\"L\",\"values\":[5,21]}],[{\"type\":\"M\",\"values\":[35,15]},{\"type\":\"L\",\"values\":[45,15]}],[{\"type\":\"M\",\"values\":[35,15]},{\"type\":\"C\",\"values\":[30,5,20,5,20,5]},{\"type\":\"L\",\"values\":[13,5]},{\"type\":\"C\",\"values\":[13,5,16,9,16,15]},{\"type\":\"C\",\"values\":[16,21,13,25,13,25]},{\"type\":\"L\",\"values\":[20,25]},{\"type\":\"C\",\"values\":[20,25,30,25,35,15]},{\"type\":\"Z\",\"values\":[]}]]}`;\n\nlet shapeDef = JSON.parse(shapesJson)\n\n// convert to polyline\nlet precision = 4\nlet polys = toPolyline(shapeDef, precision);\n\n// render new polyline elements\npolys.forEach(poly =&gt;
