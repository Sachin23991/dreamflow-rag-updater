(It also makes more sense to call <code>incident_edges</code> something like <code>neighbor_vertices</code> if you follow this.)</p>\n<p>Also, I will reply the questions based on your <strong>current code</strong>.</p>\n<p>1. I don't know where you got the idea of <code>incoming</code> from, but considering how it is <code>False</code> in the textbook, it suggests that it follows this (scroll to bottommost) &gt; <a href=\"https://csiflabs.cs.ucdavis.edu/%5C%7Etyfeng/ecs34/C++/graphs.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://csiflabs.cs.ucdavis.edu/%5C~tyfeng/ecs34/C++/graphs.html</a> which means that it's instead meant to be <code>outgoing</code> , so when it is <code>False</code> it reports the number of incoming edges. So, something like:</p>\n<pre><code>def degree(self, u, out): # remember 'outgoing' variable already exists, so calling it 'out' here.\n    if (out):\n        return len(self.outgoing[u])\n    return len(self.incoming[u])\n</code></pre>\n<p>2. <code>incident_edges</code> (or <code>neighbor_vertices</code> I suggest) will be like:</p>\n<pre><code>def incident_edges(self, u):\n        return self.outgoing[u]\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to follow the textbook, you need to loop through all the edges, then return the edges that start with <code>u</code> .</p>\n<p>3. Your understanding of<code>Edge.opposite(self, u)</code> is correct, it just doesn't make sense when you already have <code>incoming</code> and <code>outgoing</code> like that. According to your textbook, if there's an edge <code>e</code> =<code>(&quot;Wash Rice&quot;, &quot;Soak Rice&quot;)</code> then <code>e.opposite(&quot;Soak Rice&quot;)</code> returns <code>&quot;Wash Rice&quot;</code> and vice versa.</p>\n<p>4. By running the implementation of the algorithm at <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/topological-sorting-indegree-based-solution/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/topological-sorting-indegree-based-solution/</a> , yes, it returns an incomplete list. Try in that website with fx:</p>\n<pre><code>addEdge(adj, 0, 1)\naddEdge(adj, 2, 1)\naddEdge(adj, 2, 3)\naddEdge(adj, 4, 5)\naddEdge(adj, 1, 5)\naddEdge(adj, 5, 2)\n</code></pre>\n<p>It only prints <code>0 4</code> .</p>\n<p>Hope these make sense, otherwise you are welcome to ask for further clarification :)</p>\n", "tags": ["python", "visual-studio-code", "data-structures", "directed-acyclic-graphs", "dsa"]}
