After you save, the stream position is at the end of the stream, and when you pass that stream, other methods start reading from the current position, so there is nothing to read. <code>ToArray</code> convert the whole stream, from the start position, that's why you can see all the data. When you create a new <code>MemoryStream</code> from that array, it will have all the data, but it's position will be at the begining, that's why it works.</p>\n<p>So, all you have to do is</p>\n<pre><code>using MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();\nwb.SaveAs(ms);\nms.Position=0;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And it should work.</p>\n", "tags": ["c#", "blazor-server-side", ".net-6.0", "closedxml"]}
