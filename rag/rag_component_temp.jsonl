A: <p>It's not really a conan question, because your air-gaped system needs some way to allow data to go from non-air-gaped to air-gaped and this is not specific to conan.</p>\n<p>If the only bridge you have available is file copy, then you can copy the conan cache from an ungapped system for this purpose. The conan cache is usually in the <code>~/.conan2</code> directory.</p>\n<p>However, if you know what your air-gapped system provides for this purpose, they you have only solved 1 percent of the conan air-gaping problem. The real conan air-gapping problem is that conan packages usually do not contain code but urls referencing those sources. This is a huge pita with most package managers and the solutions they recommend are less than practical.</p>\n<p>Are there package management system that solved this problem? I have not tried Nix but I have been told it has. Note that Nix is not just a system package manager like rpm, apt, arch etc... Would be great is someone can leave a comment about their experiences with Nix in general and regarding air-gaping.</p>\n<p>Update: Just to not discourage you from using Conan, I do use conan air-gaped since a few days only. I find the recommended way unnecessarily ugly, it works, but aside from this, I am really happy with Conan.</p>\n", "tags": ["conan"]}

{"id": "951ca1da-ebb9-40f1-8cc3-ffb54b80c568", "text": "Q: Printing a stack trace of a hung thread A: <p>One problem is that the state of the stream in the C++ <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_library\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">runtime library</a> could be inconsistent at the time the signal handler is executed. Therefore, you should not be calling any stream I/O functions from the C++ standard library in the signal handler, as this may cause the program to crash.</p>\n<p>However, depending on which platform you are using, it is likely possible to print output from the signal handler in a safe way.</p>\n<p>For example, on Linux, it is safe to call functions that are explicitly listed as <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal-safety.7.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>async-signal-safe</code></a>. The system call <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>write</code></a> (which bypasses the C++ stream) is a function that is listed as <code>async-signal-safe</code>, so it allows you to print output safely from a signal handler.</p>\n<p>Another problem is that <code>std::stacktrace</code> uses the default memory allocator, which could also be in an inconsistent state when the signal handler is executed. Therefore, using it from the signal handler may result in a crash.</p>\n<p>However, it is possible to create a <a href=\"https://www.en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/basic_stacktrace.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>std::basic_stacktrace</code></a> object which uses your own memory allocator instead of the default memory allocator. If this allocator of yours is only used by the signal handler, and the signal handler is guaranteed to not be called again before the first call has finished executing (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrancy_(computing)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reentrancy</a>), then it should be safe to use this memory allocator, as long as this memory allocator does not call any functions that are not <code>async-signal-safe</code>.</p>\n<p>This means that on Linux, your memory allocator cannot call <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>mmap</code></a> from inside the signal handler, because that function is not listed as <code>async-signal-safe</code>. However, your allocator is allowed to for example allocate memory from a memory buffer that was previously allocated using the default memory allocator outside the signal handler.</p>\n<p>But doing all of this is rather complicated. Therefore, in the case described in the question, the easiest thing to do would probably be to create a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_dump\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">core dump</a> of the process, and to generate a stack trace from that core dump.</p>\n", "tags": ["c++", "multithreading", "stack-trace", "c++23"]}

I just never have installed it on my virtual machine.  So whenever I have analyzed code that incorporates their functions and variable definitions (e.g. &quot;string&quot;, getString(), and so forth), I just replace that code with functionally equivalent variables or functions found in &quot;stdlib.h&quot; and/or &quot;stdio.h&quot; (e.g. &quot;char *&quot;, &quot;fgets()&quot;, and so forth).</p>\n<p>The next thing to note is the replacement of hard-coded numeric values, sometimes referred to as &quot;magic numbers&quot; with defined constants, again to simplify the code.  And to simplify testing so as to not have to determine if the incoming argument character values are uppercase or lowercase, a simple calculation of each character in the argument converts each character to its corresponding offset value.  Doing that simplifies the testing downstream in the code.</p>\n<p>Also, in lieu of defining variables that will be used throughout the program within loops, those variables are defined at the beginning of the program, again to balance readability and scope.</p>\n<p>With that, it allowed for the expansion of functionality within this program to not only encrypt messages, but also decrypt messages.  Following are some sample tests that include the expected output from the original issue as well as sample output from the Wikipedia example for Vigenere encryption.</p>\n<pre><code>craig@Vera:~/C_Programs/Console/Vigenere/bin/Release$ ./Vigenere e bc\nMessage..: ABCDE ABCDE\nEncrypted: BDDFF CCEEG\ncraig@Vera:~/C_Programs/Console/Vigenere/bin/Release$ ./Vigenere e oculorhinolaryngology\nMessage..: attacking tonight\nEncrypted: ovnlqbpvt hznzeuz\ncraig@Vera:~/C_Programs/Console/Vigenere/bin/Release$ ./Vigenere d oculorhinolaryngology\nMessage..: ovnlqbpvt hznzeuz\nDecrypted: attacking tonight\n</code></pre>\n<p>The main takeaway is not that the resulting code from the initial issue is incorrect, as it does work, but rather to provide some food for thought on how to review initial code to come up with iterative steps to utilize usual and customary coding methods to make evaluating the code easier and more streamline without sacrificing functionality.</p>\n", "tags": ["c", "loops", "encryption", "cs50", "vigenere"]}
