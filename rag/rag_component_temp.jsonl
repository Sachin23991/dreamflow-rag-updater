A: <p>Basically to match a multi-line problem message, in your <code>tasks.json</code> you have a <code>&quot;problemMatcher&quot;</code> where the <code>&quot;pattern&quot;</code> is not a single object but an array of objects; these are the patterns for the individual consecutive lines and they all will create separate child entries in the tree.</p>\n<p>For instance, with my error output:</p>\n<pre><code>E &quot;ide_core.c&quot;,L571/C16:        b_bufhd\n|    Selection of a member from a non-structure is attempted.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I can use this matcher to match it:</p>\n<pre><code>            &quot;problemMatcher&quot;: [\n                {\n                    &quot;owner&quot;: &quot;mcc&quot;,\n                    &quot;pattern&quot;: [\n                        {\n                            &quot;regexp&quot;: &quot;^E \\&quot;([^\\&quot;]*)\\&quot;,L([0-9]+)\\\\/C([0-9]+): (.*)$&quot;,\n                            &quot;file&quot;: 1,\n                            &quot;line&quot;: 2,\n                            &quot;column&quot;: 3,\n                            &quot;message&quot;: 4,\n                        },\n                        {\n                            &quot;regexp&quot;: &quot;^\\\\|(.*)$&quot;,\n                            &quot;message&quot;: 1,\n                            &quot;loop&quot;: true\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n</code></pre>\n<p>(Reminder: Starting with an ordinary ECMAScript regular expression, which you can test at e.g. regex101.com, and may already have things internally that have been escaped with <code>\\</code>, like the <code>/</code> and <code>|</code> in my example, since the regular expressions for <code>&quot;regexp&quot;</code> are going into a quoted string in a JSON file, after that you need to escape <code>&quot;</code> -&gt; <code>\\&quot;</code>  and those <code>\\</code>-&gt;<code>\\\\</code>.)</p>\n<p>The last object in the <code>&quot;pattern&quot;</code> array can have a <code>&quot;loop&quot;</code> setting set to <code>true</code> which makes it repeat that line pattern on subsequent lines until the next line no longer matches. So in my example any further lines starting with <code>|</code> will continue to be handled.</p>\n<p>But there is a catch: every line pattern has to have matched at least once for the problem matcher to be considered to have found a problem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks#_defining-a-multiline-problem-matcher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks#_defining-a-multiline-problem-matcher</a></p>\n<p>They have a kind of strange case that they use for exposition, multiple separate error messages for the same file that are grouped by filename, which doesn't really fit the functional spec as suggested in the visual you linked, i.e. individual error messages that span multiple lines. Their presumable misunderstanding that this reflects maybe explains this strange limitation a bit.</p>\n<p>Depending on the exact form of your messages maybe you can sort of cheese it to get what you want.</p>\n<p>In my example, there are also single-line errors like:</p>\n<pre><code>E &quot;ide_core.c&quot;,L405/C8: Integer constant expected.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This matches the first line pattern, but since it has no following line with <code>|</code>, this matcher doesn't match it. So I have to have a separate <code>&quot;problemMatcher&quot;</code> entry to match those.</p>\n<p>However it can't just be a separate matcher with just the same first line pattern again as its whole <code>&quot;pattern&quot;</code>, as that will take all the matches away from the multi-line matcher. I have to sort of spot an otherwise irrelevant thing that's specific to the single-line-only pattern and use it to create a more specific matcher for just the single line case.  For instance in my multi-line error the message part on the first line only has a single identifier and the message part on the single line messages always have at least two words on the first line. So I can do:</p>\n<pre><code>                {\n                    &quot;owner&quot;: &quot;mcc&quot;,\n                    &quot;pattern&quot;: \n                        {\n                            &quot;regexp&quot;: &quot;^E \\&quot;([^\\&quot;]*)\\&quot;,L([0-9]+)\\\\/C([0-9]+): +([^ ]+ [^ ]+.*)$&quot;,\n                            &quot;file&quot;: 1,\n                            &quot;line&quot;: 2,\n                            &quot;column&quot;: 3,\n                            &quot;message&quot;: 4,\n                        }\n                    \n                },\n            ],\n</code></pre>\n", "tags": ["visual-studio-code"]}

A: <p>There are two &quot;main&quot; ways to safely create dynamically allocated storage in C++.</p>\n<p>1: Smart Pointers.<br />\n2: Containers.</p>\n<p>These are distinct patterns, and each has its own &quot;style&quot; for implementing safe, non-leaking storage. You don't generally mix the two.</p>\n<p>A doubly linked list is a container, so I would not use smart pointers to implement it.</p>\n<p>I would note that <code>std::list</code> has all the properties of a doubly linked list and is therefore likely implemented that way in all standard implementations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I struggle to find an elegent way to implement this with smart pointers instead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The trouble is that each &quot;frame&quot; of the dynamically linked list is &quot;owned&quot; by a single object (the list), but has pointers from two other &quot;frame&quot;s (the previous and the next frame). So, trying to use smart pointers does not match the pattern that these smart pointers are used to implement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I could implement it using shared pointers,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do you mean <code>std::shared_ptr</code>?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>but I heard that these should be saldom used and that you should attempt implementing using unique_ptr by default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes. You are have spotted the contradiction in the pattern. If you have a doubly linked list then there are two pointers to each &quot;frame&quot;. So you would either need to use a <code>std::shared_ptr</code> and have ownership of each frame shared between the prev/next frame (this is very painful as this introduces cycles with cycles), or you can use <code>std::unique_ptr</code> but here you can only have one owner so only one of the pointers (say <code>next</code>) is the owning pointer, while <code>prev</code> is a non owning pointer. This works but is an asymmetric pattern thus hard to think about and introduces its own complexities.</p>\n<p>In this situation the best pattern (in my opinion) is a C pointer (between frames). The &quot;frames&quot; don't own each other they are just linked together. The container is the owner of all the &quot;frames&quot; and it is the responsibility of the container to manage the memory of all the frames via its constructors / destructors.</p>\n<p>Some very good discussion about linked list implementations on <a href=\"https://codereview.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bc%2B%2B%5D+linked+list\">Code Review</a></p>\n", "tags": ["c++", "c++17", "idioms"]}
