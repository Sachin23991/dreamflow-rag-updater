Both were running iOS 26.1, Xcode 26.1.1. You said you could reproduce on an iPhone 17 simulator.</p>\n<p>The explanation is that it all depends on the screen width and dynamic text size.</p>\n<p>I discovered that when the button container fits within a width of approximately half the screen width, the spacers have no effect. But when the minimum container width is more than about half the screen width, it expands to the full screen width, with spacers working in the usual way.</p>\n<p>So as a workaround, the toolbar content can be shown as an overlay over <code>Color.clear</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code>Color</code> is greedy and grabs as much as possible.</li>\n<li>The overlay with the <code>HStack</code> automatically adopts the frame of the underlying view.</li>\n<li>The <code>Spacer</code> then work in the usual way, expanding to consume the excess space.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre class=\"lang-swift prettyprint-override\"><code>.toolbar {\n    ToolbarItemGroup(placement: .keyboard) {\n        Color.clear\n            .overlay {\n                keyboardButtons\n            }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8pH0NuTKm.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\" /></p>\n", "tags": ["ios", "swift", "swiftui"]}

Second, and maybe even more important, is that <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>'s Add() operation is not thread safe. You might end up with something that has more elements than the input list, or less, or even some exception being thrown.</p>\n<p>To do a thread safe parallel processing, you need to either lock the list for the insert, or use a thread safe collection, such as <code>ConcurrentDictionary&lt;T1, T2&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>A possible solution thus looks like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"><code>Parallel.ForEach(list, name =&gt;\n{\n    var processedItem = new Person(name); // Do the expensive stuff here\n    lock (people)\n    {\n        people.Add(processedItem);\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note a few things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The order of the result will still be random</li>\n<li>The processing (in this example just a constructor call) must be outside the lock, or you defeat the purpose of the parallel loop</li>\n<li>If the processing is really as cheap as in this example, there's no benefit in using a parallel loop, rather the opposite, due to extra overhead.</li>\n</ol>\n", "tags": ["c#", "list", "parallel-processing", "parallel.foreach"]}
