A: <p>First things first:</p>\n<h1>Reset your token!</h1>\n<p>Your bot's token is like a username and password in one. Anyone who obtains it can <strong>take any action whatsoever as if they were your bot</strong>, including talk through it and delete channels and stuff like that. I redacted it from your question via edit but I strongly urge you to go to the Discord portal and reset it now.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>That aside, the primary issue:</p>\n<p>The error is clearly written. <code>Error: Cannot find module 'C:\\Users\\monst\\Downloads\\Serverchat\\index.js'</code>. This means you have no file in that folder named <code>index.js</code>. Seeing it's a discord bot as well, perhaps you meant <code>node bot.js</code> instead? If not, your code may be in another working directory. Change your working directory in your command prompt using <code>cd</code> to where you've located your bot's code and <code>node_modules</code>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>One other thing: JavaScript cannot represent Snowflakes as raw numbers - precision loss will cause the last few numbers to change slightly. For this reason, discord libraries (including discord.js) require you to pass IDs as strings, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>let channel = client.channels.cache.get(&quot;742454971450261557&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n", "tags": ["node.js", "discord.js", "minecraft", "mineflayer"]}
