This &quot;something&quot; might involve throwing an exception, but if the stack is unwinding due to some other exception, it's fine for the &quot;something&quot; not to happen.</p>\n<p>I understand the ambiguity when multiple exceptions are active and why destructors shouldn't throw. I posed this question because the sanctioned advice out there seems to be &quot;don't do this&quot;, and I think what I'm doing is absolutely commonplace in the course of professional production C++ development!</p>\n<p>I need a way for the compiler to help me ensure I don't forget a return path. The &quot;flag&quot; is just a toy example - it could be anything that needs to happen on (successful!) function exit. I feel there should be a way to indicate the logic in my &quot;wrapped&quot; function above without actually having to wrap the function every time.</p>\n<p>In real life I need the &quot;flagging&quot; to throw because it's actually 20 function calls deep and very complex, and it needs to return control to an outer loop on exception. I need the compiler to help because the &quot;complicated flow control&quot; is too complicated for me to catch every return path. I understand that there is some theoretically cleaner approach, but I'm curious whether others can relate to how often this situation comes up for them.. and how painful it is that the scope_guard can't really handle this when exceptions are involved.</p>\n", "tags": ["c++", "scopeguard"]}
