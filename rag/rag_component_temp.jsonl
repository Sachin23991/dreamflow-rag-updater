You can simply limit the width of the slider and centre it. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>#slider {\n    overflow: hidden;\n    max-width: 900px;\n    margin: 40px auto;  /* centres it and adds space around it */\n    padding: 0 15px;    /* optional inner spacing */\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Adjust the width, margin and padding to whatever fits your layout. In many cases, adding padding around the slider (or wrapping it in a container div) is all you need.</p>\n<p>A few other points that might help</p>\n<p>1. Semantics<br />\nYour slider uses a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> containing several images. <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> is intended for <em>one</em> piece of media (optionally with a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>), not a collection.</p>\n<p>2. Accessibility<br />\nAuto-playing sliders can be difficult for some users, and yours doesn\u2019t currently offer any way to pause or navigate manually. If this slider is more than just decorative, think about adding controls and making sure they\u2019re keyboard-accessible. Also consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>using meaningful <code>alt</code> text (or <code>alt=&quot;&quot;</code> for decorative images)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>providing a visible focus outline</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>labelling the region, e.g.:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;slider&quot; role=&quot;region&quot; aria-label=&quot;Featured image slider&quot;&gt;\n    \u2026\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>3. CSS structure / naming<br />\nAt the moment you\u2019re styling everything via <code>#slider</code>. IDs work, but they\u2019re very rigid. As your project grows, using a naming convention like <strong><a href=\"https://getbem.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BEM</a></strong> (e.g. <code>.slider</code>, <code>.slider__track</code>, <code>.slider__slide</code>) usually makes styles easier to scale, reuse and maintain. Classes are also more flexible than IDs in general.</p>\n", "tags": ["html", "css", "slider"]}

That it is bound to a variable isn't essential, so &quot;<code>mystack</code> is <strong>of type</strong> <code>State [Int] Int </code>&quot; isn't enough, because that requires the name <code>mystack</code>.  That is how I asked the question, though.</p>\n<p>Now I can say something like &quot;In this function definition, the first term/expression/inhabitant of type <code>State [Int] Int</code> contains a function such that ..., while the second term/expression/inhabitant of that type contains a different function.&quot;  Not sure that &quot;contains&quot; is appropriate, but I'd leave that for a different question.  People sometimes talk about monads as containers, even though that doesn't always seem sensible, e.g. for <code>Nothing</code>.  Good to know about &quot;action&quot;.  Sounds odd to me, but still.</p>\n", "tags": ["haskell", "terminology"]}
