In fact it does <em>nothing,</em> as, considering it's C++ code, it shouldn't compile, or subsequently, work at all.</p>\n<p>I'm afraid the question-asker thinks that this line of code creates a file on their system:</p>\n<p><code>File file = new File(filePath)</code></p>\n<p>To begin, if this is C++ code, it shouldn't even compile, as they're allocating a new Object to a File that is not a pointer, while is immediately an error. But let's say they're intention was to create a new pointer of type File. If this was the case, &quot;File *file = new FIle&quot; does not create (or <strong>touch</strong>, in a bash shell sense) a file on their system, it only creates a pointer that references the file named in filePath, should it exist.</p>\n", "tags": ["android", "file", "file-io"]}
