With the inventory numbers thus found we will then look at matching equipments, and with their number_auditory we will then look for the ID_department in the auditory table.</p>\n<p>Indexes for this:</p>\n<pre><code>create index idx1 on inventorylist (&quot;ID_total&quot;) include (&quot;inventory_number&quot;);\n-- or the one you already have:\ncreate index idx1 on inventorylist (&quot;inventory_number&quot;) where &quot;ID_total&quot; in (2, 3);\n\ncreate index idx2 on equipment (&quot;inventory_number&quot;) include (&quot;number_auditory&quot;);\ncreate index idx3 on auditory (&quot;number_auditory&quot;) include (&quot;ID_department&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The second CTE is later needed to get the DeptStats for all &quot;good&quot; departments. So we'll probably start with looking for auditories with these department IDs and then collect all their equipment.</p>\n<pre><code>create index idx4 on auditory (&quot;ID_department&quot;) include (&quot;number_auditory&quot;);\ncreate index idx5 on equipment (&quot;number_auditory&quot;) include (&quot;inventory_number&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>If equipment.&quot;inventory_number&quot; cannot be null, then you should replace <code>COUNT(e.&quot;inventory_number&quot;) as cnt</code> by <code>COUNT(*) as cnt</code> in order to plainly show that you are merely counting rows. And in this case you can of course also remove <code>include (&quot;inventory_number&quot;)</code> from idx5.</p>\n<p>The main statement is joins on the department ID (one of them an anti-join). The department table should have an index on its department ID, which is probably its primary key. You could gain a little speed from including the name in the index, though, because then the index would already contain all the information needed and the table itself wouldn't have to be read.</p>\n<pre><code>create index idx6 on department (&quot;ID_department&quot;) include (&quot;name&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Some of these indexes you already have. Your index idx_equipment_audit_inv for instance can be used instead of my index idx5.</p>\n", "tags": ["sql", "postgresql", "performance"]}
