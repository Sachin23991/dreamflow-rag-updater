You choose.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use virtual threads for tasks that involve <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(computing)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">blocking</a>.</li>\n<li>Use platform threads for:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU-bound\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CPU-bound</a> tasks.</li>\n<li>Tasks that call long-running <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_(computing)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">native code</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Java 21/22/23, use platform threads for tasks with long-running code that is <code>synchronized</code>. For Java 24 and later, use virtual threads, per <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/425\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JEP 425</a>.</p>\n<h2>No default</h2>\n<p>You asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why not just make them the default?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In modern Java, we generally do not address threads directly. Instead, we use the Executors framework added years ago in Java 5.</p>\n<p>In particular, in most cases a Java programmer uses the <a href=\"https://download.java.net/java/early_access/loom/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Executors</code></a> utility class to produce an <a href=\"https://download.java.net/java/early_access/loom/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>ExecutorService</code></a>. That executor service is backed by various kinds of thread factories or thread pools.</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to serialize one task after another, we would use an <a href=\"https://download.java.net/java/early_access/loom/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newSingleThreadExecutor()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">executor service backed by a single thread</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor() ;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you browse through <code>Executors</code> class Javadoc, you will see a variety of options. \ud83d\udc49 None of them is &quot;default&quot;. The programmer chooses one to suit the needs of her particular situation.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/loom/Main\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Project Loom</a>, we will have at least one more such option to choose from. In the preview build of Java, call the new <a href=\"https://download.java.net/java/early_access/loom/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()</code></a> to get an executor service backed by <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/425\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">virtual threads</a>. Go nuts, and throw a million tasks at it.</p>\n<pre><code>ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor() ;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>why are they separate things?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the highest priorities for the Java team is backward-compatibility: Existing apps should be able to run without surprise.</p>\n<p>Virtual threads have a <em>very</em> different behavior and performance profile than platform threads. So I do not expect to see the Java team retrofitting virtual threads onto existing features of Java generally. They may choose to do so, but only if absolutely certain no detrimental effects will surface in the behavior of existing apps.</p>\n<h1>When to choose or avoid virtual threads</h1>\n<p>You asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is there any reason to not use them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, certainly. Two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CPU-bound tasks</li>\n<li>Tasks used to indirectly throttle other resources</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CPU-bound tasks</h3>\n<p>The entire point of virtual threads is to keep the &quot;real&quot; thread, the platform host-OS thread, busy. When a virtual thread blocks, such as waiting for storage I/O or waiting network I/O, the virtual thread is &quot;dismounted&quot; from the host thread while another virtual thread is &quot;mounted&quot; on the host thread to get some execution done.</p>\n<p>So, if your task\u2019s code does not block, do not bother with virtual threads. But this kind of code is rare. Most tasks in most apps are often waiting for users, storage, databases, networks, attached devices, etc. An example of a rare task that might not block is something that is <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/425\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CPU-bound</a> like video-encoding/decoding, scientific data analysis, or some kind of intense number-crunching. Such tasks should be assigned to platform threads directly rather than virtual threads.</p>\n<h3>Throttling</h3>\n<p>Another reason to avoid virtual threads is with existing code that depends on the limits or bottlenecks of platform threads to throttle their app\u2019s usage of other resources. For example, if a database server is limited to 10 simultaneous connections, then some app have been written to use an executor service backed by only 8 or 9 threads. Such existing code should not be blindly switched to virtual threads.</p>\n<p>Of course such code is less than optimal. Such a code base would be better, clearer, more obvious to comprehend if explicit limiting/throttling mechanisms were utilized.</p>\n<p>Using explicit throttling mechanisms will be needed if a programmer wants to benefit having thousands, even millions, of simultaneous virtual threads while avoiding exhausting/overloading other limited resources.</p>\n<p>Java has long offered such throttling mechanisms. They just were not always used, given the simplicity/ease of relying on the limits/bottlenecks of a limited number of platform threads.</p>\n<h3>Other contraindications</h3>\n<p>Virtual threads are not appropriate in two more situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Long-running calls to native code (JNI, Foreign Functions, etc).</li>\n<li>Long-running code that is <code>synchronized</code>, in Java 21/22/23, before Java 24. See <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/491\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>JEP 491: Synchronize Virtual Threads without Pinning</em></a>. Non-issue in Java 24/25 and later.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In both cases the virtual thread scheduler is unable to detect blocking.</p>\n<h2>For more info</h2>\n<p>For details, see the articles, talks, and interviews of Ron Pressler, Alan Bateman, or Jos\u00e9 Paumard.</p>\n", "tags": ["java", "project-loom"]}
