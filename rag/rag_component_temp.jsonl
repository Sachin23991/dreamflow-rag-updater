A: <p>A colleague of mine solved this generic problem in his PhD thesis:<br />\n<em>M. van Ginkel, \u201cImage Analysis using Orientation Space based on Steerable Filters\u201d, 2002 (Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands)</em></p>\n<p>His solution might be overkill for the trivial example in the OP, as it combines detecting lines (and also edges) and separating intersecting lines at different angles, whereas OP\u2019s image is already segmented (it\u2019s a binary image) so doesn\u2019t need detection. Still, this is an interesting approach that is widely applicable.</p>\n<p>The solution introduces the so-called <em>orientation space</em>. It augments the 2D image with a 3rd dimension that encodes the orientation of the local structure at each pixel.  Because two intersecting lines have a different orientation at the point of intersection, in the orientation space they no longer intersect, they become separated.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1aUGNl3L.png\" alt=\"Image showing how two circles separate in orientation space (taken from Ginkel's thesis, I'm sure he doesn't mind)\" /></p>\n<p>For each of the 2D planes in this new 3D image, the tool filters the image with an orientation-sensitive line detector at a different angle. <code>order</code> below determines how many of these different filters are applied (you sample <code>2 * order + 1</code> orientations). Because we're doing detection, we also need a threshold. Note also that none of this assumes we're looking for circles, this could be any collection of curves.</p>\n<p>In the orientation space, we threshold to isolate the lines detected from the background, and then we label. Intersecting lines do not intersect in the orientation space, so each will get a different label. We then need to project back to a 2D space for display, but we could continue working in the 3D image if we wanted. When projecting, pixels at the intersection point must be labeled as belonging to one of the two intersecting lines, if we stay in 3D we don't need to make this choice.</p>\n<p>The tool is implemented in DIPlib (<code>pip install diplib</code>), see <a href=\"https://diplib.org/diplib-docs/analysis.html#dip-OrientationSpace-Image-CL-Image-L-dip-uint--dfloat--dfloat--dip-uint-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the docs</a>.
