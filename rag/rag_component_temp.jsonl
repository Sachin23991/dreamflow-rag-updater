A: <p>like battery percent changes and when it gets plugged in and out. The program is for my touchbar on my mac (see <a href=\"https://asahilinux.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Asahi Linux</a> for linux on M series macs) and I want to put the battery percentage and time on it as well as a bunch of other things. Most of them are working but I'm stuck on the battery. Also the documentation is really technical and i dont want to sift through so much code so I came here to try and find the best solution.</p>\n", "tags": ["c", "events", "polling", "batterylevel"]}

That dependency looks off:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>implementation(&quot;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-json&quot;) // Good\nimplementation(&quot;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-jackson2&quot;) // Pretty sure this doesn't exist\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just use <code>spring-boot-starter-json</code> - it should include Jackson 2.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Maybe check if your ObjectMapper is actually being used:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>@Bean\n@Primary\npublic ObjectMapper objectMapper() {\n  ObjectMapper objectMapper = jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder.createXmlMapper(false).build();\n  objectMapper.registerModule(new CustomModule());\n  System.out.println(&quot;Modules: &quot; + objectMapper.getRegisteredModuleIds());\n  return objectMapper;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>3.
