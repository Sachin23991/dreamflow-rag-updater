Ignite can do it, easy.</p>\n<p>While there are many ways of doing this, the canonical and the most efficient would be the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Create a table <code>STREAM_SUMS</code> with the stream name as the key and the sum in the value.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Use <a href=\"https://ignite.apache.org/docs/ignite3/latest/developers-guide/data-streamer#streaming-with-receiver\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Data Streamer with Custom Receiver</a> to write the data in.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In the receiver code, read the existing value of the stream sum, add the new value, and write it back. The receiver needs to be <a href=\"https://ignite.apache.org/docs/ignite3/latest/developers-guide/code-deployment/code-deployment\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">deployed</a> on the servers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>On the client, just write your events.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How it works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The client automatically batches the events and sends them in a reactive stream with backpressure. This maximizes network efficiency.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The client automatically routes the events to the node that stores each of the aggregates (called &quot;partition awareness&quot;). This ensures that there is no extra traffic between the servers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The server never needs to send any data back to the client - all of the processing happens server-side in the receiver. This allows to avoid any extra traffic between the servers and the client.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "tags": ["ignite", "tensor"]}
