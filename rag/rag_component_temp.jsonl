{"id": "247663ea-7100-4ef4-a2f1-10c87329fe1b", "text": "Q: How to get sane definition of uint32_t when using newlib? A: <p>C standard does not specify which standard integer type <code>uint32_t</code> should alias to, or if it should alias to any standard type at all. Your assumption that <code>uint32_t</code> should be <code>unsigned int</code> is just that - an assumption. It holds true for gcc/glibc combo; it doesn't for gcc/newlib combo because newlib maps <code>uint32_t</code> to <code>__UINT32_TYPE__</code> which is defined in gcc to be <code>unsigned long</code> for 32-bit newlib targets. You'd need to patch gcc or newlib to make it into <code>int</code>.</p>\n<p>This is a very common mistake to make (e.g. I very recently saw llvm build issue because of their usage of <code>std::max</code> on <code>int32_t</code> and <code>int</code> arguments) but mistake nonetheless. Can't assume <code>uint32_t</code> is <code>unsigned int</code>, can't assume it can be losslessly converted to <code>unsigned int</code> (after all, int <em>can</em> be 16 bit), gotta use correct format specifiers. Like said in the comment, <code>PRIx32</code> macro is the only correct specifier for <code>uint32_t</code>. Alternatively one could do an explicit conversion to unsigned long, and print that converted value instead.</p>\n<p>EDIT: You are insistant you may use '%x' because uint and uint32_t happens to be same width on your particular target. Well no you may not, not according to C standard. '%x' is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>unsigned int</strong> argument is converted to ... unsigned hexadecimal notation (x or X)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>%x</code> implies <code>unsigned int</code> and nothing else. This is a singular type you may use. Anything else is not a valid C code; it might work on your target but it won't on another. Details of your particular target are not important. Like @user2357112 said <code>uint32_t</code> is no different from <code>long</code> in this matter - that's NOT unsigned int and can't be used. The compiler correctly warns you that your code is not a standard-compliant C code.</p>\n<p>If you want to use '%x' with <code>uint32_t</code>... well, its your code. Use it. You could patch gcc/newlib to make uint32_t alias to unsigned int (I think this is the place to do it - <a href=\"https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/config/newlib-stdint.h#L38\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/config/newlib-stdint.h#L38</a>), or you could just switch that warning off. Regardless of that your code would still be violating C standard (though it would work just fine as long as you stick to common 32/64 targets).</p>\n", "tags": ["newlib"]}
