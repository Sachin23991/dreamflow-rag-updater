It silently upgrades your package and also other packages while installing. You might in this <code>pip install</code> be able to maintain the version you want. But the next time you install another package - it can silently upgrade everything.</p>\n<p>You need rigid control over your python packages versions. Something that creates and maintains a <code>.lock</code> file!</p>\n<p>Back in 2022/2023 I was using <code>conda</code> in combination with <code>poetry</code> to get the package versions locked and to evade <code>pip</code>'s mess.\n<code>poetry</code> however and also <code>conda</code> is super slow. So while producing a similar environment like you want - it was very well possible that the resolution of the dependencies with <code>poetry</code> or <code>conda</code> can take 30 min and more.</p>\n<p>But if I would do it today there is only solution: <code>uv</code>.\nIt is 10-100x faster than <code>pip</code> or <code>poetry</code> and also <code>conda</code> in resolving dependencies and installing them. You are done in seconds with installations - or sometimes a fraction of a second.</p>\n<p><code>uv</code> creates a <code>uv.lock</code> file - like <code>poetry.lock</code>. This keeps your versions locked and safe in further installations.</p>\n<pre><code># install uv following\n# https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\n# don't do `pip install uv` - it has many disadvantages\n\n# cd to your project folder\nuv init  # activate uv\n\n# look at https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/\n# where cuda versions and compatible torch versions are listed\n# torchaudio==2.0.2\n# CUDA 11.7\n# conda install pytorch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia\n\n# in order to use that, the highest python version allowed is Python 3.11\n# so first install the Python version via uv\nuv python install 3.11\n# then pin your project to use Python 3.11\nuv python pin 3.11\n# now you can install the pytorch versions which use cuda 11.7\nuv add torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 \n\n# install ipython for trying out stuff in it\nuv add ipython\n\n# and then remember you have to start with `uv run` any of the commands\n# directed to this environment\nuv run ipython   # now you can try things out.\n\n# if you leave out `uv run` then you are outside of the environment.\n# and the uv environment is invisible for you, despite you being in the project folder.\n\n# so when you want to run `python myscript.py`, you have to do: `uv run python myscript.py`.\n</code></pre>\n", "tags": ["pytorch", "pip", "conda"]}
