{"id": "95649305-4749-4956-b7e4-c8cbb91282e9", "text": "Q: How to get the path of a library from its handle (macOS / iOS)? A: <p>I'm surprised at how little information there is out there for this. Many of the solutions out there were not available on macOS / iOS. Others still, were only about getting the path of the <em>current</em> executable, and had nothing to do with the handle.</p>\n<p>After a TON of searching, I finally came across some resources saying to iterate through all the loaded images using <code>_dyld_image_count()</code> and <code>_dyld_get_image_name()</code>. I initially decided against this, as it just didn't seem like an unreasonably slow way of doing things.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I decided to go with iterating over all the loaded images, as it was the only actual solution I had come across. I googled for examples, and couldn't find any tutorials on the topic. However, I did come across an open source C++ library that implemented the functionality (found <a href=\"https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/boost/dll/detail/posix/path_from_handle.hpp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>I translated it to normal C, and got rid of some excess things (such as stripping the handle). During the testing process, I noticed that the library I wanted was always last in the list (my best guess is that it stores them in the order they were loaded, and since mine isn't a system library, it will be one of the last ones loaded). This guaranteed a slow performance (in reference to the computer - to a human it'd still be nearly instantaneous). So, I did a clever optimization that started the search at the <em>end</em> of the list, rather than the beginning.</p>\n<p>This is the final code for my solution:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-obj-c prettyprint-override\"><code>// NOT a thread safe way of doing things\nNSString *pathFromHandle(void* handle)\n{\n    // Since we know the image we want will always be near the end of the list, start there and go backwards\n    for (int i = ((int)_dyld_image_count() - 1); i &gt;= 0; i--)\n    {\n        const char* image_name = _dyld_get_image_name(i);\n        \n        // Why dlopen doesn't effect _dyld stuff: if an image is already loaded, it returns the existing handle.\n        void* probe_handle = dlopen(image_name, RTLD_LAZY);\n        dlclose(probe_handle);\n        \n        if (handle == probe_handle)\n        {\n            return [NSString stringWithUTF8String:image_name];\n        }\n    }\n    \n    \n    return NULL;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's important to note that this solution is not thread safe, as <code>_dyld_image_count()</code> and <code>_dyld_get_image_name()</code> are inherently not thread safe. This means that any other thread could load / unload an image and have a negative impact on our search.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the <a href=\"https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/boost/dll/detail/posix/path_from_handle.hpp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">resource</a> I used questioned why <code>dlopen</code> didn't have an effect on <code>_dyld_image_count()</code>. This is because if an image is already loaded, <code>dlopen</code> does not load a new instance of the image, but rather returns the existing handle for it.</p>\n", "tags": ["ios", "xcode", "macos", "handle", "dylib"]}
