The solution is to run acme.sh twice, first to issue the cert, second to install and add reloadcmd. As far as I can find, this is only mentioned in this very brief issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/issues/4003\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/issues/4003</a></p>\n<p>Mechanically I can only assume that the <code>--install-cert</code> option expects the certificate to already exist in the acme.sh, <strong>and</strong> it happens to be executed first by acme.sh's internal logic, even if you write it after <code>--issue</code> in the commandline.</p>\n<p>i.e. for this specific situation,</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>DOMAIN=my.example.com\n# issue first\nacme.sh --domain $DOMAIN --webroot /path/to/my/httpchallenge\n# then install and add reloadcmd\nacme.sh --domain $DOMAIN --install-cert \\\n  --reloadcmd /path/to/my/reload.sh/$DOMAIN\n  --cert-file /path/to/my/crt/$DOMAIN/cert \\\n  --fullchain-file /path/to/my/$DOMAIN/fullchain \\\n  --key-file /path/to/my/$DOMAIN/key\n</code></pre>\n", "tags": ["ssl-certificate", "acme.sh"]}
