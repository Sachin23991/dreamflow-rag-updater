A: <p>Explanation provided by <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4663670/aergistal\">aergistal</a> is perfect, but if you are confused by the counter intuitiveness of this passage:</p>\n<p>It's a bit counter-intuitive but a <strong>VBV underflow</strong> signals an encoder rate buffer <em>overflow</em> (video bitrate larger than the input rate) while a <strong>VBV overflow</strong> signals an encoder rate buffer <em>underflow</em> (video bitrate lower than input the rate).</p>\n<p>You have to think of VBV from decoder's perspective. Let me clarify few terms here (assuming data transmission over network, as in, encoded data is transmitted over internet):</p>\n<p>video bitrate - the rate at which decoder consumes bits from its buffer</p>\n<p>input bitrate - rate at which decoder buffer is being filled. (as per our assumption, its' network bandwidth)</p>\n<p>why decoder video bitrare is not constant: In reality decoder can't pull bits from its buffer at constant rate because some frames (I) are larger in size, thus decoder needs to pull more bits and some are smaller in size (P or B), requiring lesser number of bits, thus decoder's bitrate is variable by nature.</p>\n<p>If we take an example of encoder encoding data at 10mbps and network provides 5mbps of bandwidth, here input bitrate becomes 5mpbs but <strong>video bitrate is not 10mbps</strong> as I said video bitrate is the rate of decoder pulling bits from it's buffer. So if decoder is pulling at lower speeds, <strong>video bitrate lower than input rate</strong> we get under <em>underflow</em> and <strong>video bitrate larger than input rate</strong> we get <em>overflow</em>.</p>\n<p>Remember <strong>VBV</strong> is a mathematical model on encoder's side simulating how a decoder's buffer would behave.</p>\n<p>So if anyone confused video bitrate to encoder's bitrate like me, the concept doesn't click in. Hope it helps someone.</p>\n", "tags": ["ffmpeg", "h.264", "video-processing", "video-encoding"]}

It has the same limitation as PowerShell has. You can extract one or more files but cannot easily add a single file to an existing zip format.</p>\n<p>For this ability you need a <code>cmd</code> written <code>exe</code> file (zip-it) as described at <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/76690779/10802527\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/76690779/10802527</a></p>\n<p>This can be done in a complex PowerShell command, but it is far easier and faster to write the exe version, rather than a ps1 one.</p>\n", "tags": ["powershell"]}
