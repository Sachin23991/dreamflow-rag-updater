I find the issue bothersome especially when it comes to secondary dependencies (or even further into the dependency tree) when people specify version when doing so is not necessary (Often it is not, or is done for only theoretical stability whereas in reality in my experience in Python module APIs don't typically change/delete endpoints/arguments but rather add them, so setting a minimum version with <strong>&gt;= is usually better than == or &lt;= in requirements</strong> but unless there are specific and known issue typically only use <strong>the sign that applies otherwise just please don't specify version at all</strong>. &gt;= can be just as annoying such as if you have to support an older version of an OS and PyPI or the distro or pipwin doesn't have a binary for the newer version of the module) and makes this issue more difficult to solve. It would have to be solved by installing each dependency and its dependencies and its dependencies (not using the pip requirement system at all, but rather specifying a list without versions yourself such as by forking or patching the requirements or typing them manually). Often you can solve it with pyenv.cfg as I specified, especially if you don't rely on dependencies that don't specify == or &lt;= for dependency versions (and your own dependency list doesn't).</p>\n<p>After writing I just noticed that this is an old question, but it is the problem I had and is still one of the top search results for &quot;install numpy without compiling&quot; (without quotes) and doesn't have the official way as an answer.</p>\n", "tags": ["numpy", "compilation", "centos", "pip"]}
