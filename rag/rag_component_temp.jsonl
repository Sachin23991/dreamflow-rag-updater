A: <p>A simple way is to use loops for an array of pointers as for example</p>\n<pre><code>int *a = NULL, *b = NULL, *c = NULL;\nint ** arr[] = { &amp;a, &amp;b, &amp;c };\nconst size_t N = sizeof( arr ) / sizeof( *arr );\n\nsize_t i = 0;\n\nwhile ( ( i &lt; N ) &amp;&amp; ( *arr[i] = malloc( sizeof( **arr[i] ) ) ) != NULL ) \n{\n    ++i;\n}\n\nif ( i != N ) // Memory was not allocated for all pointers \n{\n    while ( i != 0 )\n    {\n        free( *arr[--i] );\n    }\n\n    // possibly return from the function\n}\n\n// continue to work with pointers\n</code></pre>\n<p>With this approach you can deal with any number of pointers without changing the code except the initializing list of the array.</p>\n<p>Pay attention to that in code in other ansswers if you will change the number of pointers then you will need to change the code in many places.
