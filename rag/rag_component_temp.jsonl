{"id": "4bfce821-fac8-4379-97dd-052ecef55f8e", "text": "Q: How exactly does SSR work when it comes to lazy loaded components? A: <p>SSR with lazy components doesn't pre-render the lazy component on the server. Instead:</p>\n<p>1. **With `ssr: true`** \u2192 Server renders placeholder/loading state. Browser receives HTML, then loads the component chunk when needed.</p>\n<p>2. **With `ssr: false`** \u2192 Component skipped entirely on server. Only rendered in browser after JS loads.</p>\n<p>**The point of SSR with lazy-loading:**</p>\n<p>- Faster initial page load (server sends HTML immediately)</p>\n<p>- Better SEO for the main content</p>\n<p>- Lazy components still load on-demand, saving bandwidth</p>\n<p>So you get the best of both: instant page delivery + code-splitting benefits. It's not &quot;render everything server-side&quot; \u2013 it's &quot;render what matters first, load the rest later.&quot;</p>\n<p>**Your confusion:** You expected SSR to defeat the purpose of lazy-loading. It doesn't \u2013 they work together. SSR handles critical content, lazy-loading handles optional/below-fold stuff.</p>\n", "tags": ["reactjs", "next.js", "lazy-loading", "server-side-rendering"]}
