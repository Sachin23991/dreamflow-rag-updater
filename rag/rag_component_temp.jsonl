However in this example the 3rd party library isn't doing that. The library method call spins off a thread then returns and eventually the <code>JobDoneEvent</code> triggers. I should make that more clear in the question.</p>\n", "tags": ["c#", "multithreading"]}

It is not telling you how clustered the table would be if you actually clustered it by that column.  If the table itself is not clustered by anything, and if you are unsure which key is best to cluster by, you may want to consider creating a materialized view for each cluster key you want to test.  Snowflake will determine whether it is best to use the table or materialized view based on the query (assuming the query always references the table).  This will cost you on storage and clustering, but after it is setup, you can take a look at query executions and determine which MV is leveraged most frequently and then cluster your table in that way...and drop the MVs...or if it is giving you the performance you want for the cost, just leave it.</p>\n", "tags": ["snowflake-cloud-data-platform"]}
