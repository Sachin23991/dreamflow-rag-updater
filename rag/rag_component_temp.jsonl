A: <p>Virtual threads are not backward-compatible with platform threads and can\u2019t be a drop-in replacement for them.</p>\n<p>Platform threads are preemptive (share CPU in time slices), virtual threads are cooperative (require certain operations to be present in the user\u2019s code to schedule another thread).</p>\n<p>Virtual threads unmount from an underlying platform thread at predefined unmount points (blocking operation, yield, synchronization, IO, sleep, etc). If no such points are present in your code, <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/444\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">it will never unmount</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The scheduler does not currently implement time sharing for virtual threads. Time sharing is the forceful preemption of a thread that has consumed an allotted quantity of CPU time. While time sharing can be effective at reducing the latency of some tasks when there are a relatively small number of platform threads and CPU utilization is at 100%, it is not clear that time sharing would be as effective with a million virtual threads.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/77352289/125562\">They are executed in a fixed pool of platform threads.</a> When the pool is busy with virtual threads refusing to unmount\u2014an effect more pronounced if some threads are <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/core/virtual-threads.html#GUID-704A716D-0662-4BC7-8C7F-66EE74B1EDAD\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pinned</a>\u2014no more virtual threads will execute.</p>\n<p>This means a new kind of deadlock may happen - tasks scheduled for execution may never execute, because there are no executors left. Platform threads carry no such risk, because the OS can preempt them - pause their execution at any point (with time-slicing) - thus achieving fair sharing of the CPU among all of them, without any cooperation.</p>\n<p>To reproduce the problem, run the following program:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executor;\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors;\nimport java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;\nimport java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean;\n\npublic class VirtualThreads {\n\n    public static int createBusyThreads(String name, Executor executor) throws InterruptedException {\n        AtomicBoolean cancelled = new AtomicBoolean(false);\n        try {\n            int i = 0;\n            for (;;i++) {\n                CountDownLatch started = new CountDownLatch(1);\n                int copy = i;\n                executor.execute(() -&gt; {\n                    started.countDown();\n                    System.out.println(&quot;Started &quot; + name + &quot; &quot; +  copy); \n                    while (!cancelled.get()) {\n                        \n                    }\n                });\n                if (!started.await(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {\n                    return i;\n                }\n                if (i == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {\n                    throw new IllegalStateException();\n                }\n            }\n        } finally {\n            cancelled.set(true);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Virtual threads: &quot; + createBusyThreads(&quot;virtual&quot;, Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) );\n        System.out.println(&quot;Platform threads: &quot; + createBusyThreads(&quot;platform&quot;, Executors.newCachedThreadPool()) );\n    }\n    \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>you will observe that much more platform threads can be started than virtual threads.</p>\n", "tags": ["java", "project-loom"]}
