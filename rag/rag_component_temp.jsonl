Everything you can trace using this or other trace options will be shown in the console.</p>\n<p>I don't know where the warning is created, but it is pretty much clear how to use the recommended option. To understand it, please see the <a href=\"https://www.electron.build/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Electron builder documentation</a>. Pay attention that you can use two very similar APIs. The documentation names them <em>Command Line Interface (CLI)</em> and <em>Programmatic API</em>.</p>\n<p>You can package your Electron application using CLI if you pre-install the builder, using the CLI command <code>electron-builder build</code>, but you are using <code>npx</code>, which is the most basic way of performing the build.</p>\n<h2>Using Programmatic API</h2>\n<p>To use the node flag <code>--trace-deprecation</code> and other flags, you can use the <em>Programmatic API</em>. Basically, you have to pre-install the builder and use in in your node application, for example, <code>your-build-script.js</code>. It can look like</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>&quot;use strict&quot;;\n\nconst builder = require(&quot;electron-builder&quot;);\nconst Platform = builder.Platform;\n\n// define all the options\n\nbuilder.build({\n  targets: Platform.MAC.createTarget(),\n  config: options\n})\n.then((result) =&gt; {\n  console.log(JSON.stringify(result))\n})\n.catch((error) =&gt; {\n  console.error(error)\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a slightly modified example from <a href=\"https://www.electron.build/programmatic-usage\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.electron.build/programmatic-usage</a>. Please see this page, as well as the detailed API description.</p>\n<h2>Using NODE_OPTIONS and npx</h2>\n<p>Alternatively, you can use npx and <code>NODE_OPTIONS</code> argument.</p>\n<p>For example (Bash):</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-bash prettyprint-override\"><code>NODE_OPTIONS=&quot;--trace-deprecation&quot; npx electron-builder build ...\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Other tools</h2>\n<p>Other options include using tools like <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>cross-env</code></a>. I never tried it, but this tool offers the way to define node options in the file <code>package.json</code>. Please see the <code>cross-env</code> documentation for the details.</p>\n", "tags": ["node.js", "electron", "electron-builder", "deprecation-warning"]}

A: <p>First, let me clarify that I am currently a senior undergraduate student, so my understanding may not be perfect.</p>\n<p>Based on my analysis, the primary cause of the excessive memory usage is the nature of certain scanned PDFs, which often embed a single very large image without a text layer.</p>\n<p>When using Apache PDFBox, the rendering and decoding pipeline tends to fully decode such large embedded images into a <code>BufferedImage</code> (i.e., a full pixel matrix). During this process, additional intermediate objects may be created for color space conversion, scaling, and rasterization, which can significantly increase peak memory usage.</p>\n<p>In contrast, PyMuPDF (which is based on the MuPDF kernel and implemented in C) appears to handle image-heavy PDFs more efficiently. It often performs more aggressive subsampling, chunk-based processing, and object reuse, resulting in fewer high-level object allocations and substantially lower memory consumption (often on the order of tens of megabytes).</p>\n<p>From a practical standpoint, memory usage with PDFBox can be mitigated by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Avoiding <code>ImageType.ARGB</code> and preferring <code>ImageType.RGB</code> or <code>ImageType.GRAY</code> when transparency is not required.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Loading PDFs using a scratch file to reduce heap pressure, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>PDDocument document = Loader.loadPDF(file, MemoryUsageSetting.setupTempFileOnly());\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>or by using a mixed memory\u2013disk strategy:</p>\n<pre><code>MemoryUsageSetting.setupMixed(50 * 1024 * 1024);\n\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "tags": ["python", "java", "pdfbox"]}
