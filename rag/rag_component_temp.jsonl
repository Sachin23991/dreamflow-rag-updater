A: <p>Assignment writers online for creating reusability codes in C++ programming emphasizes helping students develop optimal programming. Reusability in programming helps programmers optimize their work through functions, classes, or templates that can be applied directly to various programs. By explaining abstract concepts like abstraction, objects, or arranging coding optimally, students can be taught to develop program components that can be reused easily. By seeking guidance from professionals, students can be made aware of strategies for creating reusable libraries, how to handleheader files, or create an optimal arrangement of code that ensures maximum efficiency in programming using C++.</p>\n", "tags": ["c++", "function", "declaration", "reusability", "modularization"]}

In CSS files, it belongs to TailwindCSS, so you can't embed classes declared in <code>.scss </code>files. Because of this separation, you don't have access to each other's declarations.</p>\n<p>In CSS Modules, as long as the module is an <code>.scss</code> file, you won't be able to reference TailwindCSS utilities for the same reason. If the CSS Module is a plain CSS file, you can include TailwindCSS again using <code>@reference</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/79743713/15167500\">How to use <code>@apply</code> in Tailwind v4?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>src/tailwind.css</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>@import &quot;tailwindcss&quot;;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>src/components/App.module.css</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>@reference &quot;./../tailwind.css&quot;;\n\nheader {\n  @apply bg-neutral-0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>It's important to reference the file that contains <code>@import &quot;tailwindcss&quot;;</code>, and you must use a relative path.</em></p>\n<p>In the related reference mentioned earlier, I pointed out that this relative path can be a bit hard to track, so it's better to rely on subpath imports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/79687963/15167500\">Aliases for TailwindCSS <code>@reference</code> by subpath imports</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>package.json</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-json prettyprint-override\"><code>{\n  \u2026\n  &quot;imports&quot;: {\n    &quot;#tailwind.css&quot;: &quot;./src/tailwind.css&quot;\n  },\n  \u2026\n} \n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>src/tailwind.css</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>@import &quot;tailwindcss&quot;;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>src/components/App.module.css</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>@reference &quot;#tailwind.css&quot;;\n\nheader {\n  @apply bg-neutral-0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, because of <code>@reference</code>, certain variables, classes, and utilities may be duplicated in the CSS Module.
