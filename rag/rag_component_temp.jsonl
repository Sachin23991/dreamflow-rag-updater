A: <p>You do not actually need to mess around with <code>sys.path</code>. The way you've created the <code>spec</code> means that the dynamic module already knows what its parent package should be (<code>code</code>), and therefore where to search for relative imports. So long as python knows how to find the package that a module has declared itself to be a part of, then everything will work. In your scenario this would be the package <code>code</code>, as you declared your module name to <code>code.foo</code>.</p>\n<p>Below I've includes a brief demo showing a module using a relative import that imports from the &quot;declared&quot; package of the module, rather than the package it is in relative to its place in the file system.</p>\n<h3><code>./pkg/some_module.py</code></h3>\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>VALUE = 'value'\n</code></pre>\n<h3><code>./for_dynamic_import.py</code></h3>\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code># Would be a root module based on where this file would be found relative to sys.path\n# But is attempting to import as if it were a submodule of pkg\nfrom .some_module import VALUE\nassert VALUE == 'value'\n</code></pre>\n<h3><code>./main.py</code></h3>\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>import importlib.util\nimport sys\n\npath = './for_dynamic_import.py'\nspec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location('pkg.foo', path)\n# NB.

Unity renders depth as a color into this render target. \nThis render target has the following purpose:\n\n    1) Improves performance on Vulkan devices.\n    2) Lets Unity get the depth buffer\n    on platforms that use the Metal graphics API, which doesn\u2019t allow fetching the depth \nfrom the DepthStencil buffer within the same render pass.\n\nThe format of this render target is GraphicsFormat.R32_SFloat.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This has to do with selecting Deferred and Deferred+ Rendering paths. At least it doesn't seem to be avoidable. I looked into the code and the only format they seem to generate is the R32_SFloat. Coupled by the fact that there's no mention of alternatives in the docs section above, I'd say, if your device does not use it, you can't use the URP's default Depth stuff.
