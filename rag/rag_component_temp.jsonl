You should see a third item in the Usage list, <code>.Options</code>. That's actually the name of the structure that holds the names and values of options so you should be able to set a particular one to <code>NULL</code> which is the standard R method to remove items from lists. I tried with:</p>\n<pre><code>.Options$demo.ask &lt;- NULL\n</code></pre>\n<p>Success.</p>\n<p>Edit: ------------</p>\n<p>The Help page for <code>Options</code> now says:</p>\n<p>\\&gt;For compatibility with S there is a visible object\u00a0<code>.Options</code>\u00a0whose value is a pairlist containing the current\u00a0<code>options()</code>\u00a0(in no particular order). Assigning to it will make a local copy and not change the original. (<em>Using</em>\u00a0it however is faster than calling\u00a0<code>options()</code>).</p>\n<p>\\&gt;An option set to\u00a0<code>NULL</code>\u00a0is indistinguishable from a non existing option.</p>\n<p>I thought that that using <code>options(key = NULL)</code> will leave an entry in the <code>.Options</code> tree, since NULL is a valid value for a list item, but I was wrong. There's no such named value after that operation.</p>\n<p>So the only way to change it would be <code>options(blogdown.hugo.dir = NULL)</code></p>\n", "tags": ["r"]}
